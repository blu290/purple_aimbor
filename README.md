# purple_aimbor
crappy CS2 aimbot, for educational purposes

offsets stolen from https://github.com/sezzyaep/CS2-OFFSETS, thanks to those people

PLEASE do not use this for VAC secured servers, not only would it be really mean, you'd probs also get banned. 

I only made this because I thought it would be funny to use against a friend.
